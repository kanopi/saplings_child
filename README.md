# Saplings Child Theme

This is a subtheme of the Ui Bootstrap Theme to demonstrate how some
integrations can be done like:

- CKEditor 5 stylesheets
- Negative margins in utility classes
- Background gradients

Those integrations cannot be done in the base theme because either not enabled
in Bootstrap default compiled CSS or impossible to do in a generic way.

## Usage

You can copy/paste this theme to init your own subtheme.

You will have to change:

- the machine names of files
- the machine names inside those files
- adapt path to the Bootstrap library to recompile assets
- if you are using this in a local testing install, it's likely that `fin init`
failed and did not prompt you to run `fin install-theme-tools` so make sure you
 do that!

## Setup Steps

Follow these steps to set up and customize your subtheme:

1. Navigate to your theme directory:

   ```
   cd web/themes/custom/saplings_child
   ```

2. Create all your custom SCSS files under the "assets/scss/custom" directory.

3. Run the following command to watch and compile SCSS files:

   ```
   npm run watch
   ```

   This command watches for changes in your SCSS files and automatically
   compiles them.

## Policy

There is no backward compatibility policy in this example theme.

Breaking change can happen at any moment.
